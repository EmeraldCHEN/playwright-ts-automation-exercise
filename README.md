## Run Playwright Rests 

To run Playwright UI and API tests in headless mode

ENV=dev npx playwright test

![Test Result](image.png)

To run Playwright API tests 

`ENV=dev npx playwright test api/*`

To run Playwright UI tests in headed mode, where you can visually observe the browser as it interacts with your app, just add the --headed flag to your test command:

ENV=dev npx playwright test ui/* --headed


ðŸŽ¯ What this does:
- Launches the browser with a visible UI (instead of running headless).
- Useful for debugging or observing animations, UI transitions, and dynamic behaviors.

ðŸ”§ Bonus: Combine with `--debug` for supercharged inspection

ENV=dev npx playwright test ui/* --headed --debug


This opens the [Playwright Inspector]("https://playwright.dev/docs/debug") so you can pause, step through, and review each action interactively.
Let me know if you're running a specific test file or need to control viewport, browser type, or tracingâ€”happy to help you fine-tune it!


ðŸ§  Timeout Scopes in Playwright
| Context | Timeout Source | Default | 
| Test as a whole | timeout in defineConfig or test.setTimeout() | 30000ms | 
| Locator actions (click, fill, etc) | page.setDefaultTimeout() | 30000ms | 
| Assertions like expect().toBeVisible() | Needs its own explicit timeout | 5000ms | 


Playwright allows you to set a global timeout and expect timeout in your config
