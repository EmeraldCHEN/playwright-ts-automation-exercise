# Playwright vs Cypress: Async Handling Comparison

| Feature               | Playwright                             | Cypress                                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Async handling**    | Uses native `async/await`               | Uses internal chaining                    |
| **Syntax style**      | Requires explicit `await`               | Looks synchronous                         |
| **Command behavior**  | Returns real Promises                   | Uses custom command queue                 |
| **Flexibility**       | More flexible (can mix APIs freely)     | Easier to read for beginners              |
| **Test execution model** | Runs outside the browser             | Runs inside the browser (limited access)  |


ðŸ§  In Summary

- Cypress handles async behind the scenes â€” no need to use `async`/`await`

- Playwright exposes Promises directly, so you must use `await` to avoid flaky tests

- Cypress is more beginner-friendly, but Playwright gives you more control and flexibility for complex scenarios (like multi-tabs, background jobs, etc.)
