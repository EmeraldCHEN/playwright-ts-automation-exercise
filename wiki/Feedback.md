- Improvement 1:
  - Description: Temporarily un-ignored the `.env` files to ensure GitHub Actions can run tests successfully.

- Feedback 1:
  - Description: In a real-world scenario, `.env` files should be excluded from source control to avoid exposing sensitive data.  Iâ€™m aware that the best practice for CI pipelines is to use GitHub Actions Secrets or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store environment variables. However, due to limited time, I did not configure secrets for this exercise.
