# Why Playwright Beats Cypress for API Testing

API testing is a critical part of test automation, especially for teams striving for fast, reliable feedback.
While both [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) offer robust capabilities, Playwright presents key advantages for API-level testing that make it a better choice for many teams.

## ⚡ Key Advantages of Playwright for API Testing

### ✅ Native Support for API Testing

- Playwright provides built-in `request` and `APIRequestContext` objects for making HTTP requests independently of the browser or UI
- Clean separation of API and UI testing improves modularity and parallel execution.

### 🔧 Better Control Over Test Context

- You can spin up browser contexts and API requests separately, allowing precise control over test environments and data
- Ideal for testing authorization flows, tokens and session management across multiple domains

### 🚀 Faster Execution

- Playwright's API tests run outside the browser, resulting in faster execution compared to Cypress which relies heavily on browser context even for API calls

### 🔄 Cross-Language Flexibility

- Playwright supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#, making it ideal for cross-functional teams
- Cypress is tightly coupled to JavaScript/TypeScript

## 🔍 Limitations of Cypress in API Testing

### ❗ API Tests Bound to Browser Lifecycle

- Cypress API calls (`cy.request`) execute within the browser context, potentially entangling API logic with UI state

### 🧱 Limited Multi-domain Testing

- Cypress has constraints when interacting with APIs from different origins, especially in multi-tenant or SSO scenarios

### 📦 Less Modular Design

- Cypress’s test structure often interweaves API and UI logic, which can impact maintainability in large projects

## 🏁 Summary

For scalable and decoupled API tests, Playwright is leaner and more powerful — ideal for fast feedback and complex workflows. It offers cleaner, faster API testing with more flexibility than Cypress.
