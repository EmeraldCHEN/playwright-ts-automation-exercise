# Reasons to Choose `@faker-js/faker` Over the Older `faker` Package

## 1. Active Maintenance & Community Support
- The original `faker` package (`faker` on npm, v5.x) was **abandoned** by its maintainer around early 2020.
- `@faker-js/faker` is a **community-maintained fork** that continues to receive active development, bug fixes, and new features.
- Using `@faker-js/faker` means you get ongoing support and compatibility with modern tooling.

## 2. Improved TypeScript Support
- `@faker-js/faker` has **better and official TypeScript typings** baked in.
- The old `faker` packageâ€™s typings are incomplete and sometimes outdated, which can cause issues in TypeScript projects.

## 3. More Reliable & Updated API
- `@faker-js/faker` has improvements, bug fixes, and some API enhancements.
- It also keeps up with new locales, formats, and other data enhancements.

## 4. Better Compatibility With Modern ESM
- `@faker-js/faker` is designed with modern ES Module support, making it easier to use in TypeScript and modern JavaScript projects.
- The old `faker` package was designed before ESM became popular and uses a different export style.

## 5. Security
- Using actively maintained packages helps avoid security vulnerabilities.
- `faker` had some past issues that are addressed in `@faker-js/faker`.

## Using `@faker-js/faker` with Playwright and TypeScript

`@faker-js/faker` works great with Playwright in TypeScript projects.

Hereâ€™s why it fits well:

- **TypeScript Support:** It has official TypeScript typings, so autocomplete and type checking work smoothly.

- **Modern ES Module Support:** Compatible with modern build tools and import syntax used in Playwright TS projects.

- **Flexible Data Generation:** You can generate realistic test data (names, emails, addresses, etc.) easily to make your tests more robust.

## Recommendation

If you want a **stable, future-proof, well-supported faker library**, switch to `@faker-js/faker`. Otherwise, the old `faker` can work for now but expect potential issues and lack of updates.
